# Enron-Data-Machine-Learning-Analysis
In this project, I've used a panel of machine learning algorithms to identify Enron employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

# Content Summary
1. my_classifier.pkl is the final classification model (SVM) I've chosen.
2. my_dataset.pkl is the Enron dataset used for this project.
3. my_feature_list.pkl contains features I've used for the classification model.
4. poi_id.py includes codes I've written to generate the files above.
5. tester.py takes in my_classifier.pkl, my_dataset.pkl, and my_feature_list.pkl and returns validation measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
